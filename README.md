### Hi, I'm Jaime ⚡

I'm a staff scientist at the department of Environmental Health Sciences @ Columbia University in New York City. If someone ask me what is my training, depending on the day, I would respond that it is on Biomedical Engineering, althought I spend most of my time writing code for computer simulations - and on a good day I would said I'm a modeler.

I enjoy using various tools such as paper-pen mathematical modeling and computer simulations to write cool stories with data (a.k.a papers).
