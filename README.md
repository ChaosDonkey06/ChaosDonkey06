### Hi, I'm Jaime

I'm a PhD student in the Program of [Biology at New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/biology.html) in [Prof. Mercedes Pascual's](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/mercedes-pascual.html) research group. My research interests are broadly infectious disease dynamics, antigenic evolution Dengue viruses forced by the environment, eco-epidemiology of pathogenic bacteria and it's implications to human population health in relatively short time-scales. I use epidemiological models and interrogate the models with data using simulation based inference methods.
