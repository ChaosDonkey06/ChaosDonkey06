### Hi, I'm Jaime

I'm a staff scientist at the department of [Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/environmental-health-sciences-ehs) @ Columbia University in New York City working with the research group of [Jeff Shaman](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/jls106/). I'm working on using computational mathematical models and robust inference to estimate and understand the spread of microorganims in hospitals.
