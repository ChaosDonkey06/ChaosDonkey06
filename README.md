### Hi, I'm Jaime âš¡

I'm a staff scientist at the department of [Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/environmental-health-sciences-ehs) @ Columbia University in New York City working with the research group of [Jeff Shaman](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/jls106/). If someone ask me what is my training, depending on the day, I would respond that it is in Biomedical Engineering, althought I spend most of my work-time writing code for computer simulations and figures and reading papers. On a good day I would said I'm a modeller, and that my training was on non-linear dynamics and control. 

I am passionate about modeling because, as scientists, we naturally tell stories about life processes. And this framework allow us to input a lot of our feelings and perception about the world in rigorous ways. When I said modeling I'm thinking about both paper-pen mathematical modeling and computer simulations.
